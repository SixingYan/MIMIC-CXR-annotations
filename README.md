# MIMIC-CXR-annotations

Here are 458 annotations used in the disease visual grounding task presented in the publication here:. The annotations were collected using the COCO web annotation tool here: https://github.com/jsbroks/coco-annotator.  Thus the annotations follow the format from the annotator, namely json with three super fields: images, categories, and annotations.
